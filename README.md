Getting my feet wet with software development

My first project will be a program that expedites reporting of observations with image files.  This program should be able to dynamically manipulate and add to a database filled with condition descriptions of predetermined categories (ie, roofing, masonry, windows, doors, sealant, etc.).  

The following features should be included in this program:
-image size compression to acceptable size for .doc reports
-drop down lists for categories and pre-entered condition descriptions
-a search function for condition descriptions
-basic markup tools for the image(ie, formattable arrows, boxes, ellipses, polygons, rectangles, circles, and a freeform pen tool)
-a truncated caption text field
-an export to .doc function that compiles the information into a numbered item (the condition description) and a table with a pre-linked reference linking them
-a field for general notes not to be compiled for the report
-a checkbox determining whether or not the photo will be used in the report


^Just for starters :)^
